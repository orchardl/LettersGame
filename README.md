# LettersGame
Super simple game to teach my 3-year-old his letters

Line 12 you can set the font size. I wanted it to fit the entire screen, so I made it enormous on my 4k screen. You may want it to be smaller (especially if you have a lower-resolution screen).

This was a fun little project. I'll probably continue it later as my son gets better at his letters (make it into a real game instead of just saying letters when he presses keys). I've never touched this particular python module, so ChatGPT helped a lot. With ChatGPT's help, I got the code working in about 30 minutes. It then took me another 15 minutes to record all of the audio files.
